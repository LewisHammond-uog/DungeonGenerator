  title: Diffusion Limited Aggression
  description: "Diffusion Limited Aggression (DLA) is the next step in the process.
    DLA normally involves having a fixed central particle and several free moving
    particles, when free moving particles collide with the fixed particle, they become
    part of the fixed structure (Witten and Sander, 1981). This process repeats until
    all particles are fixed. In this project I repurposed DLA, as proposed by Wolverson
    (2020), to destroy the walls of the dungeon when particles collide with them.  
    \r\n\r\nThis process makes the rooms generated by BSP look less artificial, addressing
    some critics concerns of the BSP technique of the dungeon appearing too artificial. "
