  title: Dykstra Maps
  description: "Finally, as described by Wolverson (2020), Dykstra Maps are the processes
    of creating a map of distances between locations in a level based on Dijkstra\u2019s
    (1959) pathfinding algorithm. \r\n\r\nDykstra Maps have a variety of uses within
    dungeon generation. In this project they are used to generate a map, shown by
    an image, that calculates the distance from the start point of the level. This
    could be used to influence the placing for spawners or enemies. \r\n"
